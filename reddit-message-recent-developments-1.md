Since I'm still occasionally getting notifications from this thread, I'm gonna add two minor revisions for anyone seeing this post from now on:

1. The cut images from Iseval's initial message detailing a short timeline for PMD's ban. I'll post a quick transcription of the two, but they're really short (I just want to add it for consistency considering I transcribed another image before when it was relevant, and considering Iseval's case was made by showing these as evidence, I feel it would be relevant to add):

Image 1: a message from what appears to be an audit log (I'm relatively unfamiliar with Discord auditing tools). Transcription as follows:

Image 2: a message from SirHartley detailing the reasoning for banning PMD

>**SirHartley** 9/03/2024 3:11 AM presidentmattdamon | 168129523806633984

>Banned for distributing the following, non-exhaustive list of mods with code that deliberately and permanently corrupted savefiles under specific conditions without any indication of doing so:
> - Exotica Technologies (their own mod), and
> - Diable Avionics (a mod they updated for another author, who was not aware of the code being added)

2. On 31 March, Avanitia (then, and AFAIK current, owner of USC) released the original message that they sent to Alex regarding the ICL scandal, by way of a screenshot quote in Alex's response in the SS Forum (Alex's response is not shown). The message is pretty long, but I'll do my best to transcribe it below:

Avanitia \[in response to a message from Solanum "Then again, it's not like the other side \[USC mods\] is less biased. There hasn't been a straight answer from any of the mods here on why they reached out to Alex...\] 3/31/2025 8:42 AM

>This was our DM to Alex sent by me.

\[image transcription\]:

>Quote from: Avanitia on February 29, 2024, 03:26:24 PM

>Hi Alex,

>I am Avanitia, current owner of the Unofficial Starsector Discord, writing on behalf of entire moderation team.

>We thought you will want to know about the following information:

>As you are aware, youtuber called IroncladLion made a video review of Iron Shell mod.

>It contained around 2-3 second of mod explicitly allowing \[redacted: SA\] in it.

>That "mod" is a fork of mod called Take No Prisoners (TNP).

>Take No Prisoners mod was taken down by its author presidentmattdamon from forums, github, discord and so on, so there is no way to downoad original mod *anywhere*.

>Which leads to current issue. At the moment Starsector Reddit (r/starsector) seems to be full of the discussion about TNP and that "forc" with people publicly and not-so-subtly saying where to download the "fork" version which contains the bad stuff.

>From what we could see, moderators of r/starsector aren't doing anything about these posts.

>And as reddit is fairly popular, we thought you will want to know about the situation as it sheds bad light on the game.

(Mods, those posts are all removed; if you'd like me to redact them, feel free to ask me, or do it yourself. I left them in in order to avoid changing the original content of the image)
