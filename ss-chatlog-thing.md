Some highlights in terms of the discussion itself (3.2/3.2):

Amogoose:

> please do

Solanum:

> Sure, why not

[tons of cut discussion]

Pwnzerfaust:

> So it looks like PMD was banned at 8:11 AM pacific time, March 8 - [redacted link, see comment (this link is the one that goes to the ban log)]

> And the ban message on Diable Avionics was at 7:53 AM pacific time, March 8 - [redacted link, see comment (this link goes to Alex's final comment on PMD's Diable Avionics forum thread)]

[tons more cut discussion]

Iseval [responding to pwn "So it looks like PMD..."]:

> **8/03/2024 - 12:50pm |** The message where it's mentioned.

> **8/03/2024 - 4:35pm |** Mods find out, immediately muted and locked out of most channels that have role restrictions, vote raised to ban.

> **8/03/2024 - 5:27pm |** Banned, initially as a nominal temp ban pending enough mods waking up to be able to formally confirm the majority so that he can't do anything.

> **9/03/2024 - 3:11am |** Ban finalised, current public ban message issued.

> I wish the audit log went back further but apparently it only spans about a month. Discord is f*king useless. Here's the Dyno log and the final ban message in my timezone for reference.

Iseval:

> Not sure if there was an interim one when he was banned ahead of the formal majority.

[message cut between]

> If you're curious, there were 0 votes against banning him.

[some discussion]

Iseval:

> That places the forum ban about 7 hours after when we banned him pre-empting the final tally.

[some discussion]

Iseval:

> If you have any other questions about the timeline, welcome to ask. I can go grab a few more timestamps to confirm the others if you like.

OmegaAirborne [in response to the above]:

> cool ig. now show the timeline for ICL

Iseval [in response to the above]:

> Sure, give me some time to go trawl discord logs... again.

[some discussion]

OmegaAirborne [in response to the above]:

> thank you

[a LOT more cut discussion]

Iseval [in response to the above]:

> Jesus CHRIST this took a while. Sorry about that. If you've dealt with discord logs and search you know.

> 25/02/2024 - 11:02 | Topic raised in mod channels about what the hell's going on. Ironclad is muted while this is discussed as is standard policy, although this is a bit of a token gesture given he's sent about 50 messages in 2 years at this point. Discussion starts here, and the topic doesn't drop for the next two days. This includes:

> Giving timestamps for any single thing isn't trivial since many of them span several recurrences as people get back to us, more mods weigh in, etc. I can try if you like, but there's a reason this took so long. It's not as clear-cut as PMD where the only real discussion was making sure he actually did it before banning him, and the entire thing spanned a handful of hours.

> 25/02/2024 - 11:08am | Message drafted. This is not sent due to pending communication with the forum end as mentioned above. This is a pretty major fuckup and we've been frank about that for quite a while now. We're only human, but this was a straight-up mistake.

> 27/02/2024 - 12:54am | Further discussion raised, now in a dedicated thread with everything so far brought together. This spans another 10 hours. We finally have responses from everyone reached out to, and end up voting unanimously in favour of a ban in light of these.

[some messages cutting between]

> 27/02/2024 - 10:11am | Ban finally issued. Yes it took this long. The discussion was still ongoing, but the vote was settled at this point.

> 8/03/2024 - 4:55pm | Concerns raised internally over the ban message being inappropriate and accusatory. Generally in agreement, but nobody wants to touch it while the fires are still burning on this to prevent accusations of hiding the original message.

> 15/03/2024 - 4:33am | Aforementioned concerns boil over. Ban message updated to be better reflective of the issue and less unreasonably inflammatory.

> 17/03/2024 - 7:02am | The exact thing editing the ban message was being hesitated over to avoid happens, and we are contacted with complaints over having edited it. Discussion is prompted over whether to just revert it.

[some messages]

Iseval:

> From there there's... a lot more.

Astarat:

> Mod team sometimes relays info about community events going on to Alex to consult on what his stance is (because it's the same as main forums' stance and we try to follow suit whenever applicable)

Iseval:

> To be clear, we're in agreement internally as well that it was handled poorly.

There's more, but IMO it's not particularly pertinent after that. LMK if you want the full logs.

EDIT 07:14: Iseval made a typo in the "Message drafted" part. They edited their message in Discord so now I'm gonna fix it here too for consistency. Below is the original content and what it was changed to:

---
