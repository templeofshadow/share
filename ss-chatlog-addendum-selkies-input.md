Addendum, Selkie's input.

(Assume that each message has at least one irrelevant message between it and the next that I cut for brevity)

(I gave up on posting people's nicknames, the logs use their handles anyways most of the time so I just used that)

(When I say "responding to the above", I mean the message immediately above. e.g. the first occurence, Rax is responding to Wisp's "the joke was not okay...")

For anyone who is unfamiliar, USC mods included in this log:

* PureTilt, Freelance Police Waifu (puretilt)
* !rubi (ceruleanpancake) (for some reason shows up as asyndeticaly in the logs)
* Wisp (wispborne)

(Some rather harsh language redacted or censored for autofilter approval)

\[redacted\] refers to unethical biological experiments conducted illegally on humans (i think that automod doesn't like the specific words used so I'm trying to dance around it)

\---

Wisp \[responding to MGY saying that it's "absurd this place felt a need to harass and ban \[IronCladLion\] over a joke"\]:

>the joke was not okay (edit: by the standards here, where he posted the video) but the USC did not handle it well either

Rax \[responding to the above\]:

>You know, I'm not really shocked by that truth.

nosnek199 \[responding to the above\]:

>the response ***could*** be considered nuclear but tbh I don't care, I wouldn't want that s\*t on my server either. - (if I was a staffer lol)

xReicher \[responding to the above\]:

>You *could* also argue then that IronShell should also be banned from here considering *that* planet description talking about sl\*vry and selling people for dubious reasons

Selkie \[responding to the above\]:

>that part was made up by ICL, the planet description alludes to illegal human experimentation but was written by someone whose first language is not english

xReicher \[responding to the above\]:

>Thanks for the clarification here. I ain't trying to cause issues lol

Thatoneguy67675:

>So wait is ironcladlion completely bullshitting?

Selkie \[assuming responding to xReicher, not explicit\]:

>no ur good, im annoyed ICL misrepresented a lot of stuff

Selkie \[responding to Thatoneguy67675\]:

>i would say there are a lot of half truths in the video

\[NOTE:

Selkie posted an image of what appears to be a YouTube comment with the above message. Below is a transcription by me.\]

>3:40 - The Yami description refers to prisoners being sold for \[redacted\], this was going to be the subject of an unimplemented quest. It not going to be framed as a good thing. idk what you are trying to imply the description meant

>9:50 - vanilla writing never goes in to detail on drug use, m\*rder, g\*nocide etc they are 1-2 short, sterile text passages and do not go into any detail. The mod you are defending goes in to great detail on the suffering it is causing. this is not comparable

>12:50 - Corvus was delisted from both the subreddit and official forum due to ties to RS \[NOTE: referring to the SA mod\], USC never had anything to do with it

>19:50 - most of the comments i saw re: the video were about RS even before the ban happened. I don't understand why you would put the mod in your video then blame others for drawing attention to it?

xReicher \[responding to the above\]:

>Also, in my opinion... that's just as bad as SA tbf. The \[redacted\] stuff that is

Selkie:

>i shouldnt have bothered putting anything in the comment re:morality because it made people discount the rest of the post calling out misinfo

nosnek199 \[responding to "i would say there..."\]:

>as far as I know, corvus also bans any mention of the mod.

MGY \[responding to "i would say there..."\]:

>The corvus line is pure slander

Selkie \[responding to the above\]:

>the facts speak for themselves, Alex delisted it after seeing screenshots of the server

GingaBomber \[responding to xReicher "Also, in my opinion..."\]:

>Now you see, the main difference is, one shows a faction doing it, what you can do to that faction is up to you, you can choose to not interfere, or satbomb them to the groud.

>The other is something you explicitly do to characters from a different mod.

nosnek199 \[responding to "the facts speak for themselves..."\]:

>All I know for certain about corvus is that the mod team there *has* banned mentions and discussion of the mod.

Thatoneguy67675 \[responding to the above\]:

>So wait is ICA \[NOTE: probably a typo for ICL\] trying to defend *that* mod? Tf?!

!rubi \[responding to the above\]:

>he's defending a joke he made referencing that mod but doesn't endorse the mod that he downloaded, played and specifically wrote into his video script for a joke

>**i think that's a fair enough description** ðŸ˜‡

MGY \[responding to "the facts speak for themselves..."\]:

>What facts? That is slander, flat out.

>And i have no way to confirm or deny if you guys didn't just pressure alex or simply lied again about corvus to delist it

PureTilt \[responding to the above\]:

>bro go ask alex

!rubi:

>how are we supposed to pressure alex lmao

Selkie \[responding to MGY "What facts? ..."\]:

>(LOL)

PureTilt:

>if you dont trust us

>he answers DMs on forum

Selkie:

>alex is a grown \*\*\* adult and can think for himself

Honestly, past this is mostly irrelevant to the topic. What I've posted should be enough to at least make the point I was trying to.
